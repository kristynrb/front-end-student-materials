# Getting Set Up!

Let's get set up with the tools you'll need!

## Sign Up for Github
Head to [Github.com](https://www.github.com) and sign up for an account. Github, at it's simplest, is the "Google Docs of Code" - we'll learn more about it later on, but for now you'll just need an account.

## Cloud9

+ **Join the Kode with Klossy organization on [Cloud9](https://c9.io)**
The main tool you'll be using is called Cloud9 - it's an IDE (Integrated Developer Environment) that is a computer in the cloud. It has a built-in text editor, command line, and file navigator. You'll be creating files in the command line, writing your code in the text editor, and looking at your file structure in the file navigator. You'll get an invite from Upperline to join the organization. Use your **Github account** to sign up for Cloud9 and join the Kode with Klossy Organization.

+ **Create a new Workspace**
Once you've signed up, you'll need to create a workspace (this is where you'll be working!). 
- Click "Create a New Workspace" 
- Create a name for your workspace and a description. Give it a name like "yourname-kode-with-klossy"
- TEAM: Select "Kode with Klossy 2017".
- HOSTED WORKSPACE: Choose "Public"
- The field for Git or Mercurial should be empty
- CHOOSE A TEMPLATE: Pick "Blank"
- Click "Create Workspace"
